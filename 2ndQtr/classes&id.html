<p class="para">BINANGKAL RECIPE
</p>
<p id="para1">Binangkal is a native doughnut from Mindanao and Visayas, but also commonly found 
    in most homegrown neighborhood bakeries or panaderias in the Philippines. It’s especially po
    pular in Cebu as a snack school kids can bring. Unlike most fried and fluffy donuts, binang
    
    kal bread is chewy, making it the perfect pair with sesame seeds. The 
    sesame seed’s nutty flavor is released with every bite and chew of the golden brown hard-crisp crust.
     <br> <br>Binangkal gets its name after how these fried spherical donuts are shaped similarly to the fruits of the 
Nauclea orientalis tree, locally called “bangkal.”  The tree’s fruits are also irregularly round,
 rough textured, and when partially opened, resembled the cracked part of binangkal.</p>
<p class="para">SUNDOT KULANGOT</p>
<p id="para2">Sundot Kulangot came from the Summer Capital of the Philippines, the City of Pines, Baguio. Name can be deceiving because underneath the
     not-so-good label with a bad connotation in mind, Sundot Kulangot is a must-try delicacy</p>
